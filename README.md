Love, is not pray!
No matter what time, anyone who doesn't love you get rid of, all is a kind of luck.
Do a wise man, calm face, because it doesn't matter if you can promise to receive, it always will come, why don't you beautiful megan, enron, put down the so-called love, swinging hands, your legs and find sunshine arrogance himself!
Then later, I go to read, read, and then to work out few back once I have my country.
Occasionally to go back to village, early in the morning wake up also can hear all kinds of familiar and unfamiliar with the birds singing.
In the familiar birdsong, still can hear the magpies cantata.
And hear the birds urged, I got up.
Then, mother and father are often found in succession to wake up.
I remember one morning, get up under birdsong the alarm to remind mother, saw that I was out of the bedroom, said to me, "son, you have a habit to get up at the sound of birds you.
I consent to the mother, in said in his heart, so are you?
